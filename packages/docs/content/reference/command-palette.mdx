The command palette provides fast keyboard-driven access to all vcad commands. Instead of navigating menus, type to search and press Enter to execute.

## Opening the Palette

| Platform | Shortcut |
|----------|----------|
| Mac | `Cmd+K` |

## Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` | Move selection |
| `Enter` | Execute selected command |
| `Escape` | Close without action |

You can also click a command to execute it, or click outside the palette to close it.

## Searching

Type any part of a command name to filter the list. The search matches both command labels and keywords:

- Type `cyl` to find "Add Cylinder"
- Type `undo` to find "Undo"
- Type `stl` to find "Export STL"

Matching text is highlighted in the results. If no commands match, you'll see "No commands found".
