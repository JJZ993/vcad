Selection is the foundation of the vcad workflow. Before performing any operation like transforms, booleans, or deletions, you need to select which parts to operate on.

## Selection Modes

### Single Selection

Click on a part to select it. This replaces any existing selection with the clicked part.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click on part | Select that part, deselect all others |
| Click on empty space | Deselect all parts |

### Hover Preview

Before clicking, hovering over a part shows a highlight preview. This lets you see exactly what will be selected.

## Multi-Selection

Hold **Shift** while clicking to add or remove parts from the current selection.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Shift+click unselected part | Add to selection |
| Shift+click selected part | Remove from selection |

This enables you to build up a selection of multiple parts for batch operations.

## Keyboard Modifiers

| Modifier | Action | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| None | Click | Replace selection with clicked part |
| Shift | Click | Toggle part in/out of selection |
| None | Click empty | Clear all selection |

## Visual Feedback

Parts display different visual states based on selection and hover:

| State | Appearance |
|-------|------------|
| Default | Normal appearance |
| Hover | Highlight outline |
| Selected | Blue selection outline |
| Hover + Selected | Both outlines |

## Feature Tree Sync

Selection state is synchronized between the viewport and the feature tree panel:

- Clicking a part in the viewport highlights it in the feature tree
- Clicking a row in the feature tree selects the part in the viewport
- Multi-selection works in both directions

This makes it easy to find and select parts regardless of where they appear in your model.

## Edge Cases

### Overlapping Parts

When multiple parts overlap at the click position, the frontmost part (closest to the camera) is selected.

### During Gizmo Drag

While dragging a transform gizmo, selection is locked. Clicks are ignored until the drag completes. This prevents accidental selection changes during transforms.

If you need to select a part that is obscured by other geometry, use the feature tree to select it by name.
