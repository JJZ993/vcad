order: 17
---

2D drafting creates technical drawings from your 3D models. vcad generates orthographic projections, hidden line views, dimensions, and GD&T annotations for manufacturing documentation.

## View Modes

Toggle between 3D and 2D modes using the view mode selector.

| Mode | Display | Controls |
|------|---------|----------|
| 3D | Interactive viewport with orbit/pan/zoom | Mouse drag to orbit |
| 2D | SVG-based technical drawing | Pan and zoom only |

## Orthographic Projections

Standard views project 3D geometry onto 2D planes. Select from the view direction dropdown.

| View | Direction | Shows |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Front | Looking along +Y | XZ plane (width x height) |
| Back | Looking along -Y | XZ plane (mirrored) |
| Top | Looking along -Z | XY plane (width x depth) |
| Bottom | Looking along +Z | XY plane (mirrored) |
| Right | Looking along +X | YZ plane (depth x height) |
| Left | Looking along -X | YZ plane (mirrored) |

## Isometric Projection

The isometric view provides a 3D-like visualization with configurable angles:

- **Standard Isometric:** 30 degrees azimuth, 30 degrees elevation
- **Dimetric:** 26.57 degrees (arctan 0.5) for technical drawings

```typescript
type ViewDirection =
  | "front" | "back" | "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"
  | "isometric";
```

## Hidden Line Removal

Edges are classified as visible or hidden based on occlusion:

- **Visible edges:** Solid lines (not blocked by any face)
- **Hidden edges:** Dashed lines (occluded by geometry)

Toggle hidden line visibility using the "Hidden Lines" control.

### Edge Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Sharp | Angle between adjacent faces exceeds threshold (default 30 degrees) |
| Silhouette | Boundary between front-facing and back-facing faces |
| Boundary | Edge with only one adjacent face (mesh boundary) |

## Dimensions

Add measurements to your drawings using four dimension types.

### Linear Dimensions

Measure distances between points or along edges.

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Horizontal | Distance measured along X axis |
| Vertical | Distance measured along Y axis |
| Aligned | Distance along the line connecting two points |
| Rotated | Distance projected at a specified angle |

<Callout type="tip">
Use aligned dimensions for angled features and horizontal/vertical for orthogonal measurements.
</Callout>

### Angular Dimensions

Measure angles between two edges or three points. Useful for chamfers, tapers, and angular features.

### Radial Dimensions

Measure arcs and circles with radius or diameter callouts.

| Type | Symbol | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| Radius | R | Internal fillets, arcs |
| Diameter | Ø | Holes, cylindrical features |

### Ordinate Dimensions

Datum-relative coordinate dimensions for precise feature positioning. Use for hole patterns and features referenced from a common datum.

### Adding Dimensions

1. Enter dimension mode
2. Select geometry (points, edges, or faces)
3. Click to place dimension at desired offset
4. Edit value to add tolerances or overrides

## GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing)

vcad supports GD&T annotations per ASME Y14.5-2018.

### Form Tolerances

No datum reference required.

| Symbol | Tolerance |
|--------|-----------|
| ⏤ | Straightness |
| ⏥ | Flatness |
| ○ | Circularity |
| ⌭ | Cylindricity |

### Profile Tolerances

| Symbol | Tolerance |
|--------|-----------|
| ⌒ | Profile of a Line |
| ⌓ | Profile of a Surface |

### Orientation Tolerances

Require datum reference.

| Symbol | Tolerance |
|--------|-----------|
| ∠ | Angularity |
| ⟂ | Perpendicularity |
| ∥ | Parallelism |

### Location Tolerances

Require datum reference.

| Symbol | Tolerance |
|--------|-----------|
| ⌖ | Position |
| ◎ | Concentricity |
| ⌯ | Symmetry |

### Runout Tolerances

Require datum reference.

| Symbol | Tolerance |
|--------|-----------|
| ↗ | Circular Runout |
| ↗↗ | Total Runout |

### Material Conditions

| Modifier | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Ⓜ | MMC (Maximum Material Condition) |
| Ⓛ | LMC (Least Material Condition) |
| (none) | RFS (Regardless of Feature Size, implicit) |

### Adding Feature Control Frames

1. Click "Add Feature Control Frame"
2. Select GD&T symbol from dropdown
3. Enter tolerance value
4. Optionally add diameter symbol and material condition
5. Add datum references (A, B, C) as needed
6. Click geometry to attach leader line

```rust
pub struct FeatureControlFrame {
    pub symbol: GdtSymbol,
    pub tolerance: f64,
    pub tolerance_is_diameter: bool,
    pub material_condition: Option<MaterialCondition>,
    pub datum_a: Option<DatumRef>,
    pub datum_b: Option<DatumRef>,
    pub datum_c: Option<DatumRef>,
    pub position: Point2D,
    pub leader_to: Option<GeometryRef>,
}
```

## Section Views

Cut through geometry to reveal internal features.

### Section Types

| Type | Cut Plane |
|------|-----------|
| Horizontal | Cut at specified Z height |
| Front | Cut at specified Y depth |
| Right | Cut at specified X position |
| Custom | Arbitrary origin and normal |

### Hatch Patterns

Solid regions are filled with crosshatch lines:

- **Default angle:** 45 degrees
- **Default spacing:** 2mm
- Holes and internal features correctly excluded from hatching

## Detail Views

Magnify regions to show fine features clearly.

1. Click "Add Detail View"
2. Draw rectangle around region of interest
3. Enter scale factor (e.g., 2x)
4. Position the magnified view on the drawing sheet

Detail views are labeled with letters (A, B, C, etc.) and display the scale factor.

## Drawing Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| View Direction | Dropdown: Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Isometric |
| Hidden Lines | Toggle visibility of dashed hidden lines |
| Dimensions | Toggle visibility of dimension annotations |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel or slider (0.1x to 10x) |
| Pan | Click and drag in 2D mode |
| Reset View | Button to restore default zoom/pan |

## Drawing Store

The UI state for 2D drawing mode is managed by the drawing store:

```typescript
interface DrawingState {
  viewMode: "3d" | "2d";
  viewDirection: ViewDirection;
  showHiddenLines: boolean;
  showDimensions: boolean;
  zoom: number;
  pan: { x: number; y: number };
  detailViews: DetailViewDef[];
}
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="View selection">
Use Front, Top, and Right views for most parts. Add additional views only when needed to show features not visible in the primary views.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Dimensioning">
Dimension to features, not edges. Place dimensions outside the part outline when possible. Avoid crossing dimension lines.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="GD&T">
Use position tolerance for hole patterns. Apply form tolerances (flatness, cylindricity) to critical mating surfaces. Reference datums in order of importance (A, B, C).
</Callout>

## Future Enhancements

- DXF export for CAM software
- PDF export for documentation
- Drawing sheets with title blocks
- Multiple views on single sheet
- Centerlines and center marks
- Weld symbols per AWS A2.4
- Surface finish symbols per ISO 1302
