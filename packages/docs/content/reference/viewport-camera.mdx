The viewport is your window into 3D space. It provides intuitive camera controls for viewing models from any angle, plus visual tools for manipulating geometry.

## Camera Controls

Navigate the 3D view with mouse or trackpad. vcad supports two control schemes:

| Action | vcad Default | Fusion-style |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Orbit | Middle-drag or two-finger swipe | Shift+Middle-drag |
| Pan | Shift+Middle-drag | Middle-drag |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel | Scroll wheel |

### Zoom Behavior

Scroll to zoom toward the cursor position (not the screen center). This makes it easy to zoom into specific areas of your model.

Additional zoom settings:
- **Zoom toward cursor**: On by default, zoom centers on mouse position
- **Invert direction**: Reverse scroll direction if it feels backwards
- **Sensitivity**: Adjust zoom speed to your preference

<Callout type="tip">
On a trackpad, use two-finger swipe to orbit and pinch to zoom.
</Callout>

### Orbit Momentum

When enabled, the camera continues moving briefly after you release the mouse, giving a smoother feel when exploring models.

## View Presets

Snap to standard views by clicking the orientation gizmo (bottom-right corner) or using keyboard shortcuts.

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Front | Looking at XY plane from +Z |
| Back | Looking at XY plane from -Z |
| Right | Looking at YZ plane from +X |
| Left | Looking at YZ plane from -X |
| Top | Looking at XZ plane from +Y |
| Bottom | Looking at XZ plane from -Y |
| Iso | Isometric view from (+X, +Y, +Z) corner |
| Hero | Presentation angle, good for screenshots |

### Orientation Gizmo

The colored cube in the corner shows your current view orientation:
- **Red** = X axis
- **Green** = Y axis
- **Blue** = Z axis

Click any face to snap the camera to that view. The camera smoothly animates to the new position while keeping the model centered.

### Reset View

Double-click on empty space in the viewport to reset the camera to the default isometric view.

## Camera Animation

Camera movements are animated with smooth transitions:
- Selecting a part frames it in the viewport
- Clicking a gizmo face animates to the aligned view
- View presets transition smoothly
- No abrupt jumps or jarring motion

The animation uses quaternion interpolation to avoid gimbal lock and ensure predictable rotation.

<Callout type="info">
During camera animation, some visual effects (ambient occlusion, shadows) are temporarily disabled to maintain smooth frame rates.
</Callout>

## Transform Gizmo

When you select a part, the transform gizmo appears at its center. Use it to move, rotate, or scale the selection.

### Modes

| Mode | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Translate | Move along axes | Drag colored arrows to move along X (red), Y (green), or Z (blue). Drag colored planes to move in two axes. |
| Rotate | Rotate around axes | Drag colored rings to rotate around each axis. |
| Scale | Resize the part | Drag axis handles for non-uniform scale, or center cube for uniform scale. |

Switch modes using the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts.

### Interaction

- **Drag an axis arrow** to constrain movement to that axis
- **Drag a plane handle** to move freely in that plane
- **Drag the center** to move/scale uniformly

The gizmo disables orbit controls while dragging, so you can precisely position parts without accidentally rotating the view.

## Snapping

Snapping helps you position parts precisely by constraining transforms to specific increments or geometry.

### Grid Snap

When enabled, translations snap to the grid increment (default 5mm). This makes it easy to align parts without typing exact values.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Grid snap | On | Snap transforms to grid increment |
| Snap increment | 5mm | Grid spacing for snap |

### Point Snap

When enabled, snap to geometry vertices when dragging. Useful for aligning parts precisely to corners or endpoints.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Point snap | On | Snap to geometry vertices |

<Callout type="tip">
Hold a modifier key while dragging to temporarily disable snapping for fine adjustments.
</Callout>

## Display Options

Control how the viewport renders your model:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Wireframe mode | Show only edges, no filled faces. Useful for seeing through geometry. |
| Grid display | Show/hide the ground plane grid. |
| Axis display | Show/hide the RGB orientation gizmo. |

## Edge Cases

The viewport handles extreme scenarios gracefully:

- **Very large models**: Camera far plane extends to 10,000 units
- **Very small details**: Near plane at 0.1 units with logarithmic depth buffer prevents z-fighting
- **Looking straight up/down**: Uses world Z as reference to avoid gimbal lock

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Common viewport shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `1` | Front view |
| `3` | Right view |
| `7` | Top view |
| `5` | Toggle perspective/orthographic |
| `W` | Translate mode |
| `E` | Rotate mode |
| `R` | Scale mode |
