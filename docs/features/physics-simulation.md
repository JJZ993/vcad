# Physics Simulation & Gym

Rapier-based rigid body physics for robotics simulation and RL policy training.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| State | `planned` |
| Owner | `unassigned` |
| Priority | `p2` |
| Effort | `l` (3-4 weeks) |
| Target | Post-cad0 |
| Depends On | URDF support |

**Note:** Wait for user demand signal before starting. cad0 milestone is higher priority.

## Problem

Robot designers need to simulate physics and train reinforcement learning policies for their mechanical designs. Currently this requires:

1. **Multiple disconnected tools** — Design in CAD, export mesh, import to MuJoCo/Isaac Sim, manually recreate joint constraints
2. **No parametric feedback loop** — Change a link length in CAD, repeat entire export/import process
3. **Expensive proprietary solutions** — NVIDIA Isaac Sim requires RTX GPU; MuJoCo Pro was commercial until recently
4. **No AI-native integration** — Training scripts can't query or modify CAD parameters programmatically

Robot designers make 50+ design iterations. Each iteration involving physics requires manual re-export and scene reconstruction.

## Solution

Integrated physics simulation with gym-style interface for RL training, all within vcad:

```
vcad Document → BRep → Collision Shapes → Rapier Simulation
       ↑                                        ↓
    Parameters ←── MCP Tools ←── Policy Actions/Observations
```

### Core Components

**1. Physics Engine Integration**
- Rapier3D for rigid body dynamics (contact, friction, joints)
- Automatic collision shape generation from BRep geometry
- Joint mapping from vcad assembly joints to Rapier joint constraints

**2. Collision Shapes from BRep**
- **Convex hull** — Default for performance (VHACD decomposition for concave shapes)
- **Trimesh** — Exact collision when convex is insufficient
- **Primitives** — Box/cylinder/sphere primitives bypass mesh generation

**3. Gym-Style Interface**
- `Observation` — Joint positions, velocities, contact forces, end-effector poses
- `Action` — Joint torques or position targets
- `step(action) → (observation, reward, done, info)` — Standard gym API
- `reset() → observation` — Reset to initial state

**4. MCP Tools for AI Training**
- `create_simulation` — Initialize physics from vcad document
- `step_simulation` — Advance physics, return observations
- `reset_simulation` — Reset to initial state
- `set_action` — Apply joint torques or targets

### Example: Train Panda Arm Reach Policy

```typescript
// Via MCP from training script
const sim = await mcpClient.call('create_simulation', {
  document: 'panda.vcad',
  timestep: 0.001,
  gravity: [0, 0, -9.81]
});

// Training loop
for (let episode = 0; episode < 10000; episode++) {
  let obs = await mcpClient.call('reset_simulation', { id: sim.id });

  while (!done) {
    const action = policy.act(obs);
    const result = await mcpClient.call('step_simulation', {
      id: sim.id,
      action: action,
      steps: 10  // 10 substeps at 1kHz = 100Hz control
    });
    obs = result.observation;
    done = result.done;
  }
}
```

**Not included:** Soft body simulation, fluid dynamics, continuous collision detection.

### Data Structures

**Rust (vcad-kernel-physics):**

```rust
/// Simulation configuration
pub struct SimConfig {
    pub timestep: f64,           // seconds, default 0.001
    pub gravity: [f64; 3],       // m/s^2, default [0, 0, -9.81]
    pub iterations: u32,         // solver iterations, default 4
}

/// Observation returned each step
pub struct Observation {
    pub joint_positions: Vec<f64>,
    pub joint_velocities: Vec<f64>,
    pub joint_torques: Vec<f64>,
    pub contacts: Vec<Contact>,
    pub end_effector_pose: Option<Transform3D>,
}

/// Action to apply
pub enum Action {
    Torque(Vec<f64>),            // Direct torque control
    Position(Vec<f64>),          // Position targets (PD control)
    Velocity(Vec<f64>),          // Velocity targets
}

/// Collision shape derived from BRep
pub enum CollisionShape {
    ConvexHull(Vec<[f64; 3]>),
    Trimesh { vertices: Vec<[f64; 3]>, indices: Vec<[u32; 3]> },
    Box { half_extents: [f64; 3] },
    Cylinder { half_height: f64, radius: f64 },
    Sphere { radius: f64 },
}
```

**TypeScript (simulation-store):**

```typescript
interface SimulationState {
  status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'paused' | 'recording' | 'playback';
  simulationId: string | null;
  timestep: number;
  currentTime: number;
  recording: SimulationFrame[] | null;
  playbackIndex: number;
  visualizationOptions: {
    showContacts: boolean;
    showForces: boolean;
    showTrajectories: boolean;
    showCollisionShapes: boolean;
  };
}

interface SimulationFrame {
  time: number;
  jointStates: Map<string, JointState>;
  contacts: Contact[];
}
```

### Joint Mapping

| vcad Joint | Rapier Joint |
|------------|--------------|
| `Revolute` | `RevoluteJoint` |
| `Prismatic` | `PrismaticJoint` |
| `Fixed` | `FixedJoint` |
| `Ball` | `BallJoint` |
| `Cylindrical` | `GenericJoint` (revolute + prismatic) |

### BRep → Collision Shape Algorithm

1. For each part in document:
   a. If part is primitive (box/cylinder/sphere), use exact shape
   b. Else tessellate BRep to mesh
   c. Compute convex hull via quickhull
   d. If part is significantly non-convex (hull volume > 2x mesh volume):
      - Run VHACD decomposition → multiple convex shapes
   e. Store collision shape with part reference

| `rapier3d` | Physics engine |
| `parry3d` | Collision detection (Rapier dependency) |
| `vhacd` | Convex decomposition |
| `nalgebra` | Linear algebra (shared with Rapier) |
